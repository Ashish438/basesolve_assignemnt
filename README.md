# basesolve_assignemnt
I have created two versions ofbaa the code for solving the given task.
The first version is built from scratch using only base python and it is in the file 'assignment.ipynb'
The second verion is built using biopython and it is in the file 'assignment_biopyhon.ipynb'
The output fasta and bed files created by the second verion of the code have _biopython attached to their name.
